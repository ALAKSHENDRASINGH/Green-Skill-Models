Problem Statement: Air pollution poses a significant challenge in urban environments, affecting both public health and the ecosystem. By accurately forecasting air quality levels, city officials can implement 
                  prompt measures to mitigate emissions or alert the public. Traditional air quality monitoring methods are constrained by the limited number of sensors and their ability to provide real-time data.
                  AI models can bridge these gaps by utilizing existing sensor information alongside weather and traffic data.

Key Objectives: -Enhance Air Quality Monitoring
                -Improve Prediction Accuracy
                -Support Timely Decision Making
                -Increase Public Awareness
                -Evaluate Environmental Impact
                -Foster Collaboration
